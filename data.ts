    At first, we started to develop RESTful APIs for our Backend, but it was the nerviest problem for backend developers and frontend developers because it has so many API methods and complex relations between them.
    So, I suggested using Apollo GraphQL to solve this problem, and we refactored our backend and frontend parts.
    After this, we could reduce the backend developerâ€™s effort and they could focus on business logic.
    And also frontend developers could simplify our frontend code and we could increase development speed further.
    Solving this problem, I realized that choosing tech stacks before development is the most important problem in making stable and reliable products and accelerating dev speed.`,
